- BuildexPoller polls GitHub repos for new tags
- if there are new tags it publishes a message to RabbitMQ using the connection/channels pool

## General Overview

- ExRabbitPool creates a pool of connections to RabbitMQ
- each connection worker traps exits and links the connection process to it
- each connection worker creates a pool of channels and links them to it
- when a client checks out a channel out of the pool the connection worker monitors that client to return the channel into it in case of a crash
- BuildexPoller polls GitHub repos for new tags
- if there are new tags it publishes a message to RabbitMQ using the connection/channels pool
